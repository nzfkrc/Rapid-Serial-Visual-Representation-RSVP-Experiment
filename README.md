# Rapid-Serial-Visual-Representation-RSVP-Experiment
The RSVP consists targets which are presented among the distractors (trial). Targets are the ones participants will be identifying at the end of the trial (response). At the end of the experiment, recorded responses are being analyzed in order to calculate short-term memory performance.
In order to run the experiment, you have to install MATLAB and Psychtoolbox. When bring all the codes into a file, run execute. Before running, do not forget to change the "file location" where codes are brought.
